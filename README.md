# tictactoe
Very rough but functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python. This game can be played in a terminal. 1.0 was my solution to a challenge given by Jose Portilla in his Complete Python Bootcamp course on Udemy. Further updates to the code are borrowing from Jose's given solution in the course. Discussion: http://scottgarland.ca/tic-tac-toe
